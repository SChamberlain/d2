      <h1>Why data management<small><br>The case for data management</small></h1>
    </div>
    
    <p> We are at an unprecedented turning point in scholarly communication, brought on by the increasingly important role of data-intensive research. Datasets and their accompanying metadata are the currency of intellectual advancement, and deserve the same amount of attention, planning and scrutiny that publications receive. 

    We have seen a huge increase in available data due to improved technology and internet-based services and tools. With this data deluge comes the problem of data management: how do we handle the huge volume of available information? This challenge is amplified by the fact that research data are seldom shared, reused, or preserved, rending them a loss for the scholarly community.</p>

    <p>DataONE is an NSF-funded project that is focused on federating existing data repositories in the earth and environmental sciences. The infrastructure being built is complemented by educational and outreach activities which inform the community about data stewardship. The project has two main tasks:
    <li>Build the cyberinfrastructure to link together existing data and facilitate the search, discovery and management of these datsets, and</li> 
    <li>Build up the community of stakeholders around data. This includes researchers, librarians, data managers, policy makers, citizen scientists, and others. </li>

      <h1>Opportunities for libraries to become key players<small><br>or, Why librarians kick ass</small></h1>
    </div>    
    <p>Librarians are authoritative curators of information. To maintain that authority it is necessary to stay on top of new formats of information exchange and, in recent years, the rising currency is data.  Librarians are well placed to move into the data management realm as they already have interdisciplinary communication skills and specialized knowledge in information organization.  They can easily apply those existing skills to assist researchers with their data management needs.</p>

    <h3>How can your institution become a DataONE member node?</h3>
    <p>If you institutation has an institutional repository, you can be a member node of DataONE.  Member Nodes store, manage, and provide access to their digital scientific data holdings, and provide metadata describing their data to DataONE. Multiple tiers exist for Member Node participation, starting with implementing the read-only data access methods, allowing organizations to evolve their participation and fulful sponsor requirements. Member Nodes may have direct connection with user communities and encompass a diversity of organizations, institutions, and capabilities.</p>

    <h3>How your community/institution may benefit.</h3>
    <p>Significant benefits of participating as a DataONE Member Node are:
    <li>Common methods of access to your data, as well as wider access to and exposure of those data</li> 
    <li>Leverage of existing investment in cyberinfrastructure and related data management practices</li> 
    <li>Cost-effective preservation of data and metadata through the DataONE cyberinfrastructure</li> 
    <li>Access to a larger community with expertise and best practice adoption in data life cycle management</li> 
    <li>Respond to increasing demands by funding agencies for long-term data management planning</li> 
    <li>Provide visibility as a community leader in supporting open and rapid access to scientific data</li> 
    <li>Facilitate recognition and credit for data and services through data citations in published literature</li> 
    <li>Provide opportunities for collaborative research</li> 
    <li>Enhance public understanding of the value of a common model for sharing science data across organizations</li></p>
      
    <h3>How to talk to researchers.</h3>
    <p>Researchers are quite dense. You have to use really small words, and be careful not to offend their ego - you may run into it as it is so big, be careful.</p>
